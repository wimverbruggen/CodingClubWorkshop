## 1. Import data in R

Open `RStudio`, create a new script by clicking on `File/ New File/ R Script` set the working directory and load the packages we'll need.

```r
# Set the working directory
setwd("your_filepath")

# Load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## 2. Create a plot

You can add more text and code, e.g.

```r
# Add your code and comments here
```

<a name="section3"></a>

## 3. The third section

Here you can add some more text if you wish.

```r
# Add more code and comments
```

At this point it would be a good idea to include an image of what the plot is meant to look like so people can check they've done it right. Replace `IMAGE_NAME.png` with your own image file:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/IMAGE_NAME.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/> </center>

This is the end of the tutorial. Here is a summary of what we learned:
